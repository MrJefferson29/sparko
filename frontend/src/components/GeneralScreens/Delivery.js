        At <Highlight>Adorable French Bulldog Home</Highlight>, we take pride in offering only the
        highest quality and healthiest puppies. Each puppy is considered a member of our family,

      <SubTitle>Safe and Comfortable Shipping Process</SubTitle>
      <Paragraph>
        Shipping your puppy may seem concerning, but we ensure that the process is safe and
        comfortable. Puppies can either be shipped in the cargo compartment or with a pet nanny who
        flies in-cabin with your puppy. We make sure all puppies are vaccinated with <Highlight>Bordetella</Highlight>
        before shipping to minimize health risks.
